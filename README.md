⚡ The False Calculator

A fun and deceptive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Unlike normal calculators, this one lies — it intentionally gives wrong results 80% of the time while looking completely legit.
Designed with a glitchy, dark terminal-style UI, it’s part joke, part experiment, and part front-end showcase.
