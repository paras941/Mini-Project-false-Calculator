🎲 False Calculator

A fun and unpredictable calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that sometimes gives incorrect results — just for laughs! 

🧠 Project Idea

This project is a playful twist on a regular calculator.
When you perform calculations, the program randomly decides whether to show correct results or false ones — keeping users guessing!

⚙️ Features

✅ Takes two number inputs from the user
✅ Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation
✅ Uses a random condition to sometimes swap or alter results
✅ Displays all calculations on the webpage (no console needed)
✅ Handles invalid inputs and division by zero

💻 Technologies Used

HTML – Structure and input fields

CSS – Basic styling and layout

JavaScript – Core logic and randomization

🧩 How It Works

User enters two numbers

Click Calculate

A random number (Math.random()) decides the mode:

Normal Mode: Correct results displayed

Random Mode: Results are mixed up 

Results appear dynamically below the button

🖼️ Example Output
Addition Calculation: 10  
Subtraction Calculation: 2  
Multiplication Calculation: 24  
Division Calculation: 3  
Exponentiation Calculation: 4096

(Sometimes results might swap or look funny — that’s the “false” mode!)

🧩 Future Improvements

✨ Add Dark / Light Mode
✨ Add a “Truth Mode” toggle (only correct answers)
✨ Style it like a real calculator with buttons
✨ Add sound effects for each operation
